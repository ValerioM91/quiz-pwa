# Quizzy

This project is a PWA game application built with React and TypeScript, and bundled with Vite. The game's logic is primarily contained within the Game.tsx component. The application features different screens for various game states, including a start screen, a game screen, and an error screen. Utility functions and constants used throughout the application are organized in the utils directory. The project follows best practices for code formatting and linting, with configurations for ESLint and Prettier included. It also leverages Tailwind CSS for styling, providing a modern and responsive user interface.
